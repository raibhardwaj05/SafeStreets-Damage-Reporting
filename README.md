SafeStreets is an *AI-powered road infrastructure monitoring platform* designed to detect, report, and manage road damage efficiently.

The system integrates *computer vision, geolocation, and web technologies* to allow citizens to report infrastructure damage while enabling municipal authorities to verify and manage repairs through a centralized dashboard.

⚠️ *Important:*
The entire system — including the *AI detection model, backend APIs, frontend interfaces, and workflow logic — was developed from scratch by our team. No pre-built solutions or cloned systems were used.*

The AI model was *custom-trained by our team using YOLO architecture* to detect:

* *Potholes*
* *Road cracks*

# 🏋️ Model Training

The YOLO detection model used in this system was **trained by our team from scratch** using a custom road damage dataset.

The model currently detects:

- Potholes
- Road cracks

The trained model file is stored as:

```
model/best.pt
```

This ensures the entire AI pipeline in this project is **fully custom-built and not dependent on third-party pre-trained solutions for this task.**

# 🧰 Tech Stack

## Backend

* Python
* Flask
* SQLAlchemy
* Flask-JWT Authentication
* OpenCV
* Ultralytics YOLO

## Frontend

* HTML5
* CSS3

---

# 🧠 Model File

Place the trained YOLO model inside the `model` folder before running the system.

```
model/
 └── best.pt
```

This model was **trained by our team from scratch** to detect road damage types such as potholes and cracks.

# ⚙️ Usage

## Citizen Workflow

1. Citizen registers or logs in.
2. Uploads an image or video of road damage.
3. AI model detects pothole or crack.
4. GPS coordinates are captured automatically.
5. Citizen submits report.
6. Report status becomes *Pending Review*.

---

## Officer Workflow

1. Officer logs in through the official portal.
2. Dashboard displays report statistics.
3. Officers review submitted reports.
4. Valid reports are verified.
5. Work notices are created.
6. Contractors are assigned for repairs.
7. Repair progress is monitored through analytics.
